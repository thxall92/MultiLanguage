# MultiLanguage
It's support multi language and change in app

### TroubleShooting
- How can I change the whole strings in app?
-> Easy, redirect to Splash page and then set locale in App `attachBaseContext` function.


- OMG, `updateConfiguration` is deprecated!
-> You can use `createConfigurationContext` instead of that.
